# Programming Assignment 3

Inorder to run the program, just modify the `input.in` file. There are 6 integers in that file:NDice,NSides,LTarget,UTarget,NGames,M.

After editting that input file, make sure you installed required packages: `pip install numpy`

Then, just use `python3 main.py` to run the program. The output should be two matrices: first one is the best choices under every situation, the second one is the winning probability in every situation. Here is one example output:
